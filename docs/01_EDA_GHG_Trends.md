# EDA – UK Road Freight Emissions

**Goal**: Explore historical GHG emissions from freight transport by road.

**Dataset**: `1. Clean&Transform_GHG Emission Transportation UK.xlsx`

**Process**:
- Filtered for 'Freight transport by road and removal services'
- Aggregated yearly emissions from 1990–2023
- Plotted emission trends
- Saved chart to `figures/road_freight_ghg_trend.png`

**Preliminary Insight**:
 
- Emissions peaked in **2006** at approximately **42,200 ktCO2e**, followed by a sharp decline between **2007 and 2009**, aligning with the global financial crisis — likely due to reduced freight activity and fuel demand.
- From **2010 to 2014**, emissions remained at their lowest in the entire period (~32,000–34,000 ktCO2e), potentially reflecting early efficiency or policy impacts.
- A **moderate rebound** occurred after **2015**, possibly linked to economic recovery and increasing demand for logistics services.
- The **post-2020 dip** may reflect **COVID-19 lockdown effects**, with disruptions in transportation, supply chains, and fuel consumption.
- However, emissions have **not returned** to pre-2007 peak levels, suggesting long-term shifts — possibly due to fuel efficiency standards, electrification trends, and sustainability targets in the freight sector.
