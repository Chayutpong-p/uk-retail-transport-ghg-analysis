# EDA – Comparison of Emissions: Road Freight, Courier, Warehousing

**Goal**  
Visualize and compare historical GHG emissions from three key logistics-related transport activities in the UK (1990–2023).

**Dataset Used**  
`1. Clean&Transform_GHG Emission Transportation UK.xlsx`

**Sectors Analyzed**  
- Freight transport by road and removal services  
- Postal and courier services  
- Warehousing and support services for transportation

**Findings**  
- **Road Freight**: Highest emitter, with a sharp drop after 2008, likely due to recession and efficiency improvements. Remained stable post-2015.
- **Courier Services**: Steady growth, reflecting rise in e-commerce and delivery demand.
- **Warehousing**: Stable emissions, slight fluctuations possibly due to operational changes or electrification.

**Chart Saved As**

**Next Step**  
Isolate and visualize **rail transport emissions** to complete modal comparison.
